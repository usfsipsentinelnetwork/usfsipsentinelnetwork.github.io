"Cryptostroma corticale","Acer spp.","Susceptibility to other stressors","future","In the pacific northwest, where summer droughts are increasing in severity, susceptible exotic host trees (e.g., Acer pseudoplatanus) will be killed off in urban areas and removed from planting lists. As drought severity increases we may see impacts on endemic maple species (e.g., A. macrophyllum, A. circinatum) depending on the pathogenicity of C. corticale to these species. ","species"
