presentation abstracts for IUFRO 2024 Sessions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>We invited you
to submit "Resilience of Forest Biodiversity to Climate Change and Pests: Civic
Engagement and Conservation in Seed Banks, Public Gardens, and Wild, Urban, and
Agroforestry Landscapes". This session is organized by members of the Society
of American Foresters, Kew Gardens, Morton Arboretum, and the US Forest
Service, and one of eight linked to the International Society of Tropical
Foresters. The deadline for abstract submissions is 2 June 2023 (3 weeks from
today). The session proposal is included below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'><b>Session
description</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>To conserve
biodiversity, multiple approaches can be taken on the ground. This
mini-symposium (Panel, Flash-talks &amp; Posters) represents experts who focus
on complementary aspects of conservation and reforestation; threat assessment,
seed collecting and banking from wild trees, collective action and civic
engagement, the roles of public gardens in conserving genetic resources,
developing genetic resistance to pests to conserve biodiversity, and the
importance of conserving genetic diversity in the face of pests and climate
change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>Seed is the
unit by which biodiversity is propagated, and therefore, protected. There is
ever increasing pollination disruption with shifting local climate conditions
and more fragmented and degraded native ecosystems. As forests and genetic
diversity are lost, so are mother trees for seed collection, in a time when
people want to greatly scale reforestation efforts. In addition to potential
declines in seed crops, global trade, biodiversity loss, and fragmentation
increase the threat of emergent insect and pathogen outbreaks, resulting in
local or range-wide extinction of iconic tree species. Therefore, there is a
global need for threat assessments, seed collection and banking of native tree
species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>In the context
of the above challenges and solutions, public gardens and arboreta are critical
to the resilience of forests and society. In addition to acting as living
collections, seed sources, and refugia of tree species, public gardens serve as
biodiversity hotspots in cities, and meeting places for public and volunteer
conservation efforts and outreach. As sentinels, trees in public gardens can be
used to proactively detect emergent disease threats. Through collective action,
exchange of information, public engagement, and local expert knowledge, "think
global, act local" could be applied to aid proactive efforts to protect forest
biodiversity from the next major pests across the world. Local experts and
civic ecologists can accomplish this by collecting seed and observing trees in
native environments, plantations, public gardens, and urban forests. Breeding
or human-directed genetic improvement presents a practical solution for
restoration of species that are impacted by emergent pest epidemics, climate
change, or other threats. The utility of breeding to protect biodiversity also
depends on the prior establishments of seed banks and other germplasm
resources. It is critical to generate a prior understanding of the diversity of
populations of tree species valued for their ecological, horticultural, or
economic and commercial characteristics, the observed or potential effects of
threats to those populations, and the role diversity could play in recovery of
species.</p>
