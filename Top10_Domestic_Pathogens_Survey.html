<h1>Expert Knowledge Survey: Top 10 Undesired Invasive Forest Pathogens in North America</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>Predicting pest impact is an exercise in the assessment of “known unknowns” when it comes to biosecurity risk (i.e., incomplete information), due to different potential impacts in new forest environments and landscapes (i.e., context dependency). In addition to incomplete information and context dependency, prioritizing risks is further complicated by value systems: variable conservation goals, desired social and ecological outcomes, and economic interests.</p>
<p>We have identified two key areas of risk uncertainty that need to be clarified in terms of the types of value that is threatened, and partitioning of past and future impact. The purpose of this survey is to use expert information to fill the gap, with your help. We have selected the participants in this survey carefully from researchers and practitioners in pathology, silviculture, and genetics from across North America. Future surveys will target international expertise on nonestablished pests. The two areas of uncertainty that will be adressed with this survey are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In order to assess future threats, a more comprehensive list of established non-native pathogens is needed, along with the best information available on their origins, impacts, and host ranges</li><br>
  <li>Scientific consensus on the types of impacts (ie. ecological vs. social) that each invasive species has had will facilitate broader consensus on prioritization of established and future threats</li>
</ol>

<h2>Survey Directions & Overview</h2>
<p><b><i><u><font color="red">IMPORTANT NOTES:</font></u></i></b></p>
<font color="red"><ul>
  <li>The second part of this survey requires Firefox or Google Chrome and may not work with Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer- we do not recomend the latter web browsers for functionality<br>
  <li>Do not use the back button to navigate to the previous page- if you wish to start the second part of the survey over, please navigate back to this page and click the button below.
  </ul></font>
<p>This survey has two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The embedded SurveyMonkey below will collect preliminary responses on definitions and value systems that may be considered in management of invasive species, as well as how you wish to be acknowledged (or not) for contributing to the second part of the survey.</li><br>
  <li><b>After completing the SurveyMonkey, click the button below</b> and you will be redirected to the second part of the survey where you will a) contribute to the list of invasive pathogens and b) rank them in terms of impact and priority according to different value systems.</li>
</ol>
